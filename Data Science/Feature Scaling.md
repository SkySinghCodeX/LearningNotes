Feature scaling is a way to make sure all our **data is on similar scale**, so that no single feature dominates other

Think of it as mixing different ingredients in a recipe, if one ingredient is much bigger , it can overpower the mixture.

Feature scaling is always **applied on a column level** and not on row level.

Common scaling methods:
1. [[Normalization]]
2. [[Standardization]]
